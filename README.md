# AED Locator Bot

Welcome to the AED Locator Bot. The bot exists to help keep servicemen and servicewomen safe across the SAF. 

The Bot runs on Telegram and can be found at http://t.me/aedlocation_bot

Bot Functionality:

    1. Finding two nearest AEDs
        a. Regardless of your location in Singapore the bot will return the location and distance of the two nearest AEDs in SAF camps
        b. The two nearest AEDs are served to ensure that if one AED is either inaccessible or unserviceable another can be easily found
    
    2. Serving the static map of a given SAF camp with AED locations pinned
        a. At any time one can find the AED locations at SAF camps using this function
        b. When a certain camp is chosen, the bot will return:
            i. An image of the camp with the AED locations pinned
            ii. A link to a google map so that the map can be zoomed in on
    
Bot Use Cases:

    1. Emergencies
        a. In the case of an emergency, servicemen/servicewomen can find the nearest AEDs to their current location to save precious seconds and ensure the lowest probablity of mortality

    2. Safety Briefs
        a. Before moving out, either to a new camp or to a different region within the same camp, safety briefs are typically conducted
